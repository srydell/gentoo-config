# Gentoo Config #

This is where I keep `portage` and `linux` kernel specific config for Gentoo machines. They are organized in `git` branches as each kernel config is machine specific. They are intended to be used as starting or recovery points for machines. They are all managed with `stow`.

As my other configs, these are very specific to me and my machines. They are probably not what you're looking for.
